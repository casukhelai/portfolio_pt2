# professional-portfolio - Updated Portfolio Page

## Description
This project is my updated portfolio. I have reached week 9 in the Full-Stack Developer course and I have a few projects to show off to a possible employer at this point! It organizes my work, my skills, and abilities, with links to my LinkedIn profile, GitHub profile, and has my resume! My motivation was to use a template just to save time and help bolster the visuals for my best projects. By using the template I've seen how someone else would construct a website like this and has made some previous confusions surrounding CSS a little clearer.
